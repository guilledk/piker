    order control on behalf of clients.

    This is the daemon (child) side routine which starts an EMS runtime

    broker executions/fills.

    ``send_order_cmds()`` is called here to execute in a task back in
    the actor which started this service (spawned this actor), presuming
    capabilities allow it, such that requests for EMS executions are
    received in a stream from that client actor and then responses are
    streamed back up to the original calling task in the same client.

    The task tree is:
    - ``_emsd_main()``:
      accepts order cmds, registers execs with exec loop

    - ``exec_loop()``:
      run (dark) conditions on inputs and trigger broker submissions

    - ``process_broker_trades()``:
      accept normalized trades responses, process and relay to ems client(s)
